### Overview
As a co‑founder and contributor on Orbital Gators, I helped design the GATOR Arms payload — a student‑built payload concept emphasizing mechanical robustness, integration readiness, and a clear test path.

### Contributions
- Concept development: mechanism concepts, packaging, integration approach
- Design for build: materials, tolerances, assembly sequence, vendor coordination
- Test planning: fixture ideas, bring‑up sequence, inspection and acceptance criteria

### Outcome
Advanced the payload from concept toward build‑ready documentation and a realistic integration/test plan for a student‑run project.
