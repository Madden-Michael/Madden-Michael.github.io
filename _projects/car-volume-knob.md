### Problem
The car’s factory controls were unreliable/awkward to use while driving.

### Solution
- Designed and 3D‑printed a compact housing and knob
- Wrote Arduino firmware to read input and send reliable volume commands
- Built and soldered a small perfboard circuit; clean wiring and mounting

### Result
An elegant, reliable control that improved daily usability — robust enough to leave installed long‑term.
