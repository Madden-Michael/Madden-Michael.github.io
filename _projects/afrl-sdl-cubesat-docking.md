### Overview
Summer 2025 internship with AFRL at Space Dynamics Lab (Albuquerque). I supported systems engineering and early mission design for a cubesat docking concept.

### Contributions
- Requirements and interfaces: drafted/updated ICD-level requirements and assumptions
- CONOPS and mission threads: nominal/off‑nominal flows and success criteria
- Trade studies: high‑level docking architectures, sensing/approach options, risk drivers
- V&V planning: early verification methods mapped to requirements

### Outcome
Delivered mission thread diagrams, requirement flowdowns, and trade results that informed next‑phase work. Focus was on clear traceability from goals → requirements → verification.
