### Overview
Teaching Assistant for the Design and Manufacturing Lab. Each semester I support ~32 students mastering manual machining and design‑for‑manufacture.

### Responsibilities
- Safety and process: shop safety checks, setup, tooling selection, process plans
- Machining fundamentals: turning, milling, hole‑making, metrology, surface finish
- Design guidance: fit/clearance choices, tolerance thinking, drawing quality

### Outcome
Improved student throughput and part quality with clear process guidance, early feedback, and practical demonstrations.
