I’m a hands-on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineer focused on systems engineering, satellite design, and production. I like solving problems that touch design and the manufacturing floor, then closing the loop with testing and verification.

## Capabilities

- Systems Engineering: requirements flowdown, ICDs, risk management, V&V planning, traceability
- Satellite/Space Systems: subsystem integration, power/thermal trades, design-to-build readiness
- Structural Analysis (FEA): sizing and margin assessments, Abaqus workflows, hand calcs sanity checks
- Mechanisms & Precision Assemblies: kinematic design, clearances/stack‑ups, drawing release for build
- Thermal Analysis & Control: conduction/radiation balances, straps and MLI, margin tracking
- Manufacturing & DFM/DFA: design for machining/assembly, vendor coordination, build bring‑up
- Test & Validation: lab test rigs, test plans/procedures, data review, corrective actions
- Documentation & Release: BOMs, work instructions, configuration management, change control

## Tools (selected)

- FEA: Abaqus for linear/nonlinear analyses; report-ready plots
- Thermal: simple trade models and visuals for radiator/MLI sizing
- Test: custom lab rigs; environmental and vibe testing support
- CAD: design and drawing for manufacturing
